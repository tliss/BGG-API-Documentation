                <h2>What is a GET request?</h2>
                <p>Typically, when you want to get information from a server, your browser (the client) submits a request. The server the returns a response.
                    The response returns information about the request the client made, as well as the content that client requested. The two main types of requests
                    are GET and POST.
                </p>
                <ul><li><em>GET</em> requests are used to retrieve data<li><em>Post</em> requests are used to insert/update remote data</ul>
                <p>There is currently no way to submit POST requests via the BGG API, so we will only be using the API to retrieve data.</p>
                <h2>CORS Issues</h2>
                <p>Because your call's domain your target's domain are different, your code will be attempting to make a 
                    <strong>cross-domain request</strong>, also known as a <strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</strong> request. This is different from an ordinary GET request. Unfortunately, BGG 
                    doesn't support CORS requests (and it has been <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1304818/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors">requested for quite a while</a>)
                    so your request will need some modification before it will work.</p>
                    <p>The current workaround for this issue is to mirror server-side access to the API using a reverse proxy and include all the necessary headers there.
                        The one we are going to examine is <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere">CORS-Anywhere</a>.</p>
