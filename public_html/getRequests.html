                <h2>What is a GET request?</h2>
                <p>Typically, when you want to get information from a server, your browser (the client) submits a request. The server the returns a response.
                    The response returns information about the request the client made, as well as the content that client requested. The two main types of requests
                    are GET and POST.
                </p>
                <ul><li><em>GET</em> requests are used to retrieve data<li><em>POST</em> requests are used to insert/update remote data</ul>
                <p>There is currently no way to submit POST requests via the BGG API, so we will only be using the API to retrieve data. Going forward, this tutorial will assume that you have knowledge of how to make a standard GET request.</p>
                
                <h2>CORS Issues</h2>
                <p>Because your call's domain and your target's domain are different, your code will be attempting to make a 
                    <strong>cross-domain request</strong>, also known as a <strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</strong> request. This is different from an ordinary GET request. Unfortunately, BGG 
                    doesn't support CORS requests (and it has been <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1304818/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors">asked to for quite a while</a>)
                    so your request will need some modification before it will work.</p>
                    <p>The current workaround for this issue is to mirror server-side access to the API using a reverse proxy and include all the necessary headers there.
                        The reverse proxy we are going to examine is <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere">CORS Anywhere</a>.</p>
                
                    <h2>Installing CORS Anywhere</h2>
                <p>To begin using CORS-Anywhere, follow these instructions (for Windows computers). http://stackoverflow.com/a/41137337/4298546</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download and install Node.js from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.</li>
                    <li>Create a blank file and call it <span class="codeStyle">package.json</span>.</li>
                    <li>In the command prompt, navigate to the same directory and install CORS-Anywhere using Node Package Manager by typing <span class="codeStyle">npm install cors-anywhere</span>. A folder titled <span class="codeStyle">node_modules</span> should be auto-generated containing the CORS Anywhere installation.</li>
                    <li>In <span class="codeStyle">\node_modules\cors-anywhere</span> you should find a file called <span class="codeStyle">server.js</span>. Run node on this file by typing <span class="codeStyle">node server.js</span> in the command prompt. You should see something like the following if the server started correctly: <span class="codeStyle">Running CORS Anywhere on 127.0.0.1:8080</span>.
                    <li>Now you can create a new HTML document to test that CORS Anywhere is working. Insert the following code into the HTML file:<br><br>
                        <div class="fiddleDiv"><script async src="//jsfiddle.net/samort7/y3s6hj91/embed/html/"></script> </li><br>
                    <li>If you open this file and check your browser's console, you should see a bunch of XML. If you do, that means CORS Anywhere is working and you're ready to move on to the next section. Don't worry about what all the XML means just yet, we'll get to that in a bit.</li>
                </ol>
