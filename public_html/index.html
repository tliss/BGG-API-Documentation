                <h2>What is BoardGameGeek?</h2>
                <p>BoardGameGeek has often been referred to as "the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> of board games". If
                    you want to learn anything and everything about board games, and interact with the hobby's most dedicated enthusiasts, BGG is the place for you.</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Welcome_to_BoardGameGeek">
                    <p>BoardGameGeek is an online board gaming resource and community. The site is updated on a real-time basis by its large and still growing user base, 
                    making the 'Geek the largest and most up-to-date place to get gaming information! There is no charge to become a registered member of BGG, although

                <p>In addition to boardgames, BoardGameGeek also supports two other offshoot sites: VideoGameGeek.com and RPGGeek.com - Both of which contain data
                accessible through BGG's API.</p>
                    
                <h2>What is an API?</h2>
                <p>API stands for <em>Application Program Interface</em>. I like this concise definition of an API given a user on the popular site Reddit.com:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1al2az/eli5_what_is_an_api_what_is_a_sdk_what_is_an_ide/c8yf4i0/">
                    <p>As opposed to a User Interface (UI), an API is an interface that is designed to be used by other applications. For example, Google Maps has a UI 
                        (which takes input via a zoom slider, a position bar, etc operated by mouse clicks), and an API (which takes input as text, commands, or coordinates 
                        directly from another program). The UI is designed to deliver images as output (human readable). The API is designed to deliver chunks of text and arrays as 
                        output (machine readable).</p>

                <p>In short, an API allows you to get data from or send data to an application. You can use data obtained in this way to build other apps. Just like Twitter and Google Maps have 
                    APIs, so too does BoardGameGeek.</p>
